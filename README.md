================

***********************How to Use Hover.css***************************  First download the hover.css file from github :  https://github.com/ILunn/Hoveran  Than How can be we use it..................  If you plan on only using one or several effects, it's better practice to copy and paste an effect into your own stylesheet, so a user doesn't have to download hover.css in its entirety.  For that fllow the below step.........  1. Download hover.css 2. In hover.css, find the 'Grow' CSS.  /* Grow */  .grow {   display: inline-block;   -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s;   transition-duration: 0.3s;   -webkit-transition-property: -webkit-transform;   transition-property: transform;   -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);   -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);   -ms-transform: translateZ(0);   transform: translateZ(0);   box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); }  .grow:hover {   -webkit-transform: scale(1.1);   -ms-transform: scale(1.1);   transform: scale(1.1); }     3. Copy this effect and then paste it into your own stylesheet. 4. In the HTML file which you'd like the effect to appear, add the class of .grow to your chosen element.  		before applying hover.css effect::  &lt;a class="button">Add to Basket&lt;/a>  		after applying hover.css effect::   &lt;a class="button grow">Add to Basket&lt;/a>   like That you can add all of the effect in your website.  **********************************  If you plan on using many of hover.css' effects on your website, you may like to reference the entire hover.css stylesheet.  1. Download hover-min.css 2. Add hover-min.css to your websites files, in a directory named css for example. 3. Reference hover-min.css in &lt;head> of the HTML page you'd like to add hover.css effects to:  			&lt;head> 				&lt;link href="css/hover-min.css" rel="stylesheet"> 			&lt;/head>  4.In the HTML file which you'd like the effect to appear, add the class of .grow to your chosen element.like bellow....   		before applying hover.css effect::  &lt;a class="button">Add to Basket&lt;/a>  		after applying hover.css effect::   &lt;a class="button grow">Add to Basket&lt;/a>
